This directory holds PromptCard specifications (pc.*) used to describe deliverable documents such as PRD/SRS/Behavior/API/Data/Architecture/Delivery/Module. Each Markdown file contains front matter with metadata (id/title/version/targets/purpose), intent/guidance prompts, rubrics, samples, regression sets, and changelogs. After editing or adding a PromptCard, run `delta card sync` to regenerate `docs/promptcards/registry.(md|json)` so delta propose/apply/archive/verify can discover the latest cards.
